# Windows UAC Prompt Clone

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Educational Purposes Only

This tool is designed for **educational red team exercises** and **security awareness training** only. Unauthorized use against systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

## Overview

This application creates a pixel-perfect clone of the Windows User Account Control (UAC) prompt that can be customized and deployed in security assessments. When users enter credentials and click "Yes," the information is sent to a Discord webhook for collection and analysis.

## üß∞ Technical Details

### Project Structure
- `index.js`: Main Electron process
- `index.html`: UAC dialog interface
- `styles.css`: Visual styling for authentic appearance
- `renderer.js`: UI interaction handling
- `preload.js`: Security bridge for Electron
- `uac.py`: Customization and build script

### Technology Stack
- **Electron**: Application framework
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: User interface
- **Python**: Customization automation
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment
- **electron-builder**: Packaging and distribution

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### Package.json Configuration
The build configuration in `package.json` can be modified for more advanced packaging options:

```json
"build": {
  "appId": "com.uac.prompt.clone",
  "productName": "UAC Prompt",
  "directories": {
    "output": "dist"
  },
  "win": {
    "target": "portable",
    "icon": "assets/icon.png"

## üìö Red Team Usage Notes

### Deployment Scenarios
- Phishing campaigns
- Social engineering assessments
- Security awareness training
- Endpoint security testing

### Operational Security
- Test in isolated environments first
- Keep logs of all deployments for security audits
- Inform leadership before deployment in production

### Effectiveness Metrics
- Credential capture rate
